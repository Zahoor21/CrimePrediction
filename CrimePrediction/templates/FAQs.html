        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>What is the Crime Forecasting System?</h3>
        <p>The Crime Forecasting System is a software solution that utilizes predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms to forecast crime occurrences in various states and Union Territories (UTs).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>How does the system predict crime?</h3>
        <p>The system analyzes historical crime data and user input parameters (such as state/UT and year) using the Random Forest algorithm to generate predictions of crime occurrences.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>What factors are considered in the crime predictions?</h3>
        <p>The system considers various factors such as historical crime rates, trends, patterns, demographic data, and socioeconomic indicators to generate accurate predictions of crime occurrences.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>How accurate are the crime predictions?</h3>
        <p>The accuracy of the crime predictions depends on the quality and availability of historical crime data, as well as the effectiveness of the machine learning algorithms used. The system aims to provide users with the most accurate predictions possible based on available data.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>How can users access the predictions?</h3>
        <p>Users can access the predictions through the system's user interface, where they can input parameters such as state/UT and year to receive prediction results in real-time.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Can the system be used for decision-making purposes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, the system is designed to assist users in making informed decisions about relocating to different areas or planning travel destinations based on safety predictions provided by the system.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Are there any plans for future enhancements to the system?</h3>
        <p>Yes, the system is continuously evolving, and future enhancements may include the integration of additional machine learning algorithms, expansion of feature sets, and real-time data integration to further improve prediction accuracy and usability.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>How can users provide feedback or suggestions for the system?</h3>
        <p>Users can provide feedback or suggestions for the system through the system's user interface or by contacting the system administrators directly. Feedback from users is valuable for improving the system and addressing user needs effectively.</p>
